* identifying usage [almost done]

== Requirements
* Ruby 1.8.4
* Ruby-GetText-Package 1.3.0 or later

== Install

 $ gem install spdr-cldr

== Usage
This libarary is unstable now. APIs will be changed.
So using gem and specify the version should be recommanded.

 require 'rubygems'
 require_gem 'cldr', '= 0.1.0'
 
 obj = CLDR::Object.new
 puts obj.core.languages["ja"] #=> Show "Japanese" in current system locale
 
 obj = CLDR::Object.new(Locale::Object.new("fr_FR"))
 puts obj.core.languages["ja"] #=> Show "Japanese" in French(fr_FR)

== Generating resources by yourself
((*NOTE*)) Both of gem and tar-ball include resources(see lib/cldr/resource/), 
so usually you don't need this.

* Download core.zip from http://unicode.org/Public/cldr/1.3.0/
* unzip it to cldr source directory
* execute "rake generate"

  $ cd cldr-0.x.0/
  $ cp ~/core.zip .
  $ unzip core.zip
  $ rake generate
